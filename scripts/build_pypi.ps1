Build and Verify Script for laketrace Package (PowerShell / pwsh)

This script performs:
- install/upgrade build tools
- clean previous builds
- verify package version
- build (sdist + wheel)
- validate with twine
- test local installation of the wheel

Usage (PowerShell):
  pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_pypi.ps1

Notes:
  - For uploads to PyPI use: python -m twine upload dist/*  (requires credentials)
  - Prefer running inside a virtualenv or CI
